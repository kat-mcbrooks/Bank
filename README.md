## Bank Tech Test

### User stories / requirements
I created a takeaway program to meet these user story requirements: 
* client can make a deposit of a numeric value (nb. from the specification, this will be a round number i.e. not a decimal)
* client can make a withdrawal of a numeric value (nb. from the specification, this will be a round number i.e. not a decimal)
* client can view/print account statement 
  * account statement displays date the transaction was made, a value in the credit (if deposit) or debit (if withdrawal) column, and the balance after the transaction
  * numbers on statement display with 2 decimal points 
  * account statement displays in the specified format as below:
```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2023 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2023 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2023 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```
